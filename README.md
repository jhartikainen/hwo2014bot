# Team IDDQD Hello World Open 2014 bot

This is the bot I used in [Hello World Open 2014](https://helloworldopen.com/).

Final ranking in Europe and Africa region:

- Qualifications round 1 - 11 out of 856
- Qualifications round 2 - 78 out of 203

## Warnings etc.

The code was written in a bit of a hurry, and was almost entirely experimental due to the nature
of the competition. It has been cleaned up slightly, but don't expect it to be the best code you've ever seen.

## Compile and install

The bot should work with GHC 7.6 or greater. Do the usual cabal install:

- `cabal configure`
- `cabal install`

Then, the bot should run using...

- `hwo2014bot`

It will give instructions on parameters, but depending on when you're reading this,
it's entirely possible the Hello World Open servers are no longer operational and you can't actually do anything with the bot.
